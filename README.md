AppHarborLookout
================

An application that runs on your system tray looking for the most recent build update on any of your AppHarbor applications.

At the moment, only the latest change to any of your applications is announced in the system tray, consider it a mere announcer (which is all I needed, feel free to re-fork and contribute).
